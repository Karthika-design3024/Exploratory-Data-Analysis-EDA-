Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Titanic Dataset

This repository contains a complete Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) workflow on the famous Titanic dataset using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly. The objective is to explore the dataset’s structure, identify patterns, detect anomalies, and extract meaningful insights through statistical summaries and visualizations.

📊EDA Overview

The analysis covers:

Data Overview

Dataset structure, data types, and missing values.

Summary statistics for numeric and categorical features.


Visualizations:

Histograms and boxplots for numerical variables.

Countplots for categorical variables (e.g., gender, class vs survival).

Correlation heatmap and pairplots for feature relationships.

Interactive visualizations using Plotly.


Insights:

Survival trends by gender and passenger class.

Fare distribution and its relation to survival.

Detection of outliers and missing data patterns.

Basic inferences drawn from the data distribution and relationships.
